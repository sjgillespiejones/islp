# ISLP
This repository is a workspace that I've set up to run through the exercises and labs in the python edition of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/).

The goal of this project is to help me learn Python and some core Machine Learning concepts. 

The libraries I've used here are [SciKit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Stats models](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/).
